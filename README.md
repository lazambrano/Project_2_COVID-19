# Project Topic:
The topic of this project is COVID-19 pandemic using updated pandemic data from CDC website
[CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36).

We build an interactive dashboard for all States and US territories. It shows average number
of cases, averge death and death percentage, average recovery and recovery percentage. We built horizontal
bar chart to show average cases and death numbers. Line chart to show trend and the curve with average cases
numbers and death percent and a gauge chart for recovery percent. All stats are average numbers per month
from start of pandemic till January 2021.

COVID-19 is a new virus and as such there is not enough data to do an in depth analysis. However as the virus continues 
to spread at an alarming rate throughout the United States and the world, our analysis shows that, the death 
rate is going down despite increased infection new cases. This could be attributed to medical professionals getting used to the virus and  
may be developing new protocols on how to treat COVID-19 patients and the effectiveness of different medications currently in use.
